# Fully Self-Contained Userland QEMU in a Container
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fkrull/qemu-user-static)

This image provides execution support for foreign-architecture binaries on amd64, using Debian's [qemu-user-static](https://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static) build of QEMU's user mode emulator.

[QEMU's user mode emulation](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html#QEMU-User-space-emulator) doesn't emulate a full system but runs a foreign binary by translating instructions and system calls. By registering this emulator with Linux's `binfmt_misc` feature, foreign binaries can be executed "magically" by transparently handing them off to QEMU (so long as all userland binaries are present).

This image registers the emulator binaries with the `F - fix binary` flag (see the relevant [Linux docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html)), a new feature in Linux 4.8. This makes the emulator work properly even within chroots and containers so that it's possible to build and run foreign-architecture Docker images.

## Requirements
* an amd64 Docker host
* Linux 4.8 or newer with `binfmt_misc` support, either built-in or as a module
* the ability to run containers with `--privileged` on the Docker host

## Usage
```
$ docker run --rm --privileged fkrull/qemu-user-static enable
```

To disable the integration again, either reboot the system or run the following command:
```
$ docker run --rm --privileged fkrull/qemu-user-static disable
```

## Cross-Building Docker Images
After registering the emulator as above, it's possible to run Docker images for other architectures:
```
$ docker run --rm -it arm32v7/debian
root@ac8b1d976479:/#
```

There is currently no way to specify what architecture to use when pulling an image from a [manifest list](https://blog.docker.com/2017/09/docker-official-images-now-multi-platform/). That means it's not possible to cross-build an image from a Dockerfile that starts with an unadorned:
```
FROM debian:stable
...
```

To cross-build an image, the target architecture needs to be specified in the `FROM`:
```
FROM arm32v7/debian:stable
...
```

The architecture can be specified as a build argument if one wants to target multiple architectures:
```
ARG TARGET_ARCH
FROM ${TARGET_ARCH}/debian:stable
...
```

Note that it depends on the image how specific architectures are referenced. The official Docker Hub images (the ones without the initial `namespace/`) use the convention shown above, but others may use other forms like separate repositories or architecture tags.
